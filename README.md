## Simple authorization example with MERN stack

---

This application have no tests, manifests and etc, because this is a simple example of auth on the frontend with using backend API

Also this project uses [**JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken)

---

### Backend stack:

- **Mongodb**
- **Express**
- **nodeJS**

---

### Fontend stack:

- **React**

---

I develeped this code for my future projects, that will have authorization routes

Also I did it just for **practice** :D
